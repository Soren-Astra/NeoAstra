						<h1>It's been a while...</h1>
						<h2>July 29th 2024</h2>
						<p>So it turns out I haven't updated the site in a while, as predicted. I have been working on other things, and sometimes not working at all because resting is good, actually.</p>
						<p>I have made the projects page, because I've mostly been working on one of them (something for the GBA Jam). It's been a lot of fun, and made me realize that I actually, really like to code (a fact that my day job kinda made me forget, after all this time). Seems like creative and stress-free projects are the way to go!</p>
						<p>For next time, I am hoping to maybe make a longer post about more things, and add a bit of art (still haven't done enough of that lately)</p>
						<p>Anyway, good night!</p>

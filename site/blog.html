                        <h1>Thoughts on identity</h1>
                        <h2>September 8th 2024</h2>
                        <p>I've been having thoughts about identities recently, so I will try to write them down here and put them <span class="tooltip">in order<span class="tooltiptext">(thoughts are fast, so that's not particularly easy)</span></span>.</p>
                        <p>Technically, I do identify as some things. I am a human, naturally (that's the thing I have the most experience in being), and if you ask me about my name and gender I can give you some answers (might vary depending on who you are). The thing is though, it doesn't really go further than that, some convenient answers for the sake of being practical. I don't identify strongly enough as anything to feel any amount of distress at being <span class="tooltip">misrepresented<span class="tooltiptext">(which is why, for example, the list of pronouns I use will only ever grow, never shorten)</span></span>.</p>
                        <p>I think this is because I don't actually identify as anything. When I look in the mirror I don't see *me*, I see the body I inhabit, just a practical tool I use to do things and interact with people. I don't really care much about being <span class="tooltip">misgendered<span class="tooltiptext">(apart from being disappointed in someone if I find out they're a transphobe)</span></span>, I don't even really care about <span class="tooltip">the name that is used for me<span class="tooltiptext">(again, except if people are being purposefully mean about it)</span></span>.</p>
                        <p>I think I'm just a collection of experiences, feelings, and opinions. And since the whole of it can never be fully seen by a person, I will always be something completely different to different people. To my familly I am a daughter, a sister, a cousin, to my colleagues I am a <span class="tooltip">colleague<span class="tooltiptext">(and maybe a bit of a weirdo)</span></span>, to my partner I am so many things. It also doesn't help that I keep being surprised that other people <span class="tooltip">Perceive Me<span class="tooltiptext">(what do you mean they know me, remember things about me, and will sometimes even <i>think about me when I'm not here</i>??)</span></span>, and always wonder who I am to them.</p>
                        <p>But to be honest, I don't particularly feel any distress about this. It can even be an occasion to have fun! That's the thought behind my current work on my robotsona: why not try making it a new "identity," just for when I'm online? I can be Soren, a device, using it/its pronouns. I can also just be Soren the french enby who is not good at social media, <span class="tooltip">it's fine!<span class="tooltiptext">(However, I will not be my IRL identity online. Internet safety! My employer will *not* get the occasion to google me and find my very cool blog!)</span></span> I can even have another name, neopronouns, <span class="tooltip">anything you like<span class="tooltiptext">(you could use fantasynamegenerator to make a new name for me every time you talk about me, though that would start getting impractical)</span></span>.</p>
                        <p>Anyway, I think those thoughts are now in the right order, but I think the concluding one just got away from me, so that's it for now I <span class="tooltip">think.<span class="tooltiptext">(adding to my todo list for this blog: putting my pronouns somewhere, and maybe add a randomizer to them)</span></span></p>

						<h1>It's been a while...</h1>
						<h2>July 29th 2024</h2>
						<p>So it turns out I haven't updated the site in a while, as predicted. I have been working on other things, and sometimes not working at all because resting is good, actually.</p>
						<p>I have made the projects page, because I've mostly been working on one of them (something for the GBA Jam). It's been a lot of fun, and made me realize that I actually, really like to code (a fact that my day job kinda made me forget, after all this time). Seems like creative and stress-free projects are the way to go!</p>
						<p>For next time, I am hoping to maybe make a longer post about more things, and add a bit of art (still haven't done enough of that lately)</p>
						<p>Anyway, good night!</p>

						<h1>The site is up!</h1>
						<h2>December 31st 2023</h2>
						<p>I have been thinking about this for a little while now. I tend to be quite bad at social media, so I usually post pretty rarely, and mostly end up just lurking. I'm hoping that with this, I will take more time to post my thoughts and projects, and allow myself to write longer posts and share more.</p>
						<p>The site is still pretty bare bones : another fun trick my brain does to me is that I struggle to finish things. This time, I forced myself to start small, to plan a few things and then implement only part of those. If I didn't, this blog probably wouldn't exist for a few more months.</p>
						<p>So! What comes next?</p>
						<ul>
							<li>First, gallery and projects, as I already have stuff to put in there.</li>
							<li>I will add stuff to the resources page along the way, as I find or make them.</li>
							<li>Watch me be unsatisfied with the blog page and remake it</li>
							<li>RSS maybe?</li>
						</ul>
